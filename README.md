# Marvel - Mobile Exercise #

This is a iOS app created using Swift and the [Marvel Developer API](https://developer.marvel.com/).
You can search and save the chracteres you like most.

## Requirements

* Xcode 11.2
* iOS 12.4 +
* Swift 5.1

For security reasons I did not leave the public and private keys of the Marvel api in the project, so it is necessary to create an account on the site [Site Developer Marvel](https://developer.marvel.com)

## Architecture

This app is using `MVVM`, with  `Coordinators` on navigate between screens.
Also this app is using Repository to abstract the datasource from the viewModel. The Repository transform the service model (or database model) to app model for the purpose of isolate this layers.

### Coordinators
An iOS navigation coordinator written in Swift 5.1.

### About
There are a lot of implementations floating around the iOS community of using Coordinators to remove the burden of navigation from `UIViewController`s. The Coordinator pattern is so broad, however, that there a lot of different interpretions of how to implement it.

This is my own take on the Coordinator pattern.

### Purpose
In my opinion, a Coordinator serves three main purposes:

1. Handle the preparation, navigation between, and presentation of at least one - but often many - view controllers.
2. Liase between different services, like a Networking Service, in order to pull business logic out of our view controllers.
3. Optionally manage child Coordinators, in order to divy up responsibilities of complex navigation routes.

### How To Use

[My article explain this implementation](https://medium.com/@uniq.nestea/coordinators-simple-approach-f7b077f933ec)

## Features

* âœ… **No Storyboard:** Views develop using view code, with no broken contraints.
* âœ… **Unit Tests:** 59 (code coverage: ~79%)
* âœ… **UITests:** 0
* âœ… **Devices:** iPhone 5s, iPhone11.
* âœ… **iOS:** 12.4+.
* âœ… **Cache:** using cache for data requested.

ðŸŒŸ ðŸ’¯ All tests passed using above configurations. ðŸŒŸ

This project takes advantage of `Protocols` and `Generics` to reuse views and cells.

On Swift 5.1 I can use `Result` type to handle network responses better. 

You can favorite a character right from the catalog screen, just do a long press over any item and the options to that character will show up.

## Pods
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects
